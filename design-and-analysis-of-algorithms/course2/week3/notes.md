### Data Structures
- Point: organize data so that it can be accessed quickly and usefully.
- Examples: lists, stacks, queues, heaps search trees, hashtables, bloom filters, union-find, etc.
- Why so many? => different data structures support different sets of operations => suitable for different types of tasks
- Rule of Thumb: choose the "minimal" data structrue staht supports all the operations you need.

#### Taking it to the next level
- level 0 - "what's a data structure"
- level 1 - cocktail party-level literacy
- level 2 - "this problem calls out for a heap"
- level 3 - "I only use data structures that I wrote myself"
