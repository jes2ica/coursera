## What is Machine Learning?

Two definitions:

 * **Arthur Samuel** described it as: "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."
 * **Tom Mitchell** provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience **E** with respect to some class of tasks **T** and performance measure **P**, if its performance at tasks in **T**, as measured by **P**, improves with experience **E**."

## Supervised Learning

In **supervised learning**, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.


Example 1: Housing price prediction

``Supervised Learning``: right answers
``Regression``: Predict continuous valued output (price)``

Example 2: Brest cancer (malignant, benign)

``Classification``: Discrete valued output (0 or 1)
