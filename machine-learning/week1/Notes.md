# What is Machine Learning?

Two definitions:

 * **Arthur Samuel** described it as: "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed."
 * **Tom Mitchell** provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience **E** with respect to some class of tasks **T** and performance measure **P**, if its performance at tasks in **T**, as measured by **P**, improves with experience **E**."
